## **A Comparison of GAN and minibatch-GAN**

### **Introduction**
The goal of this projects is providing a comparison between simple GAN and the minibatch GAN. MNIST datasets have been used for this purpose.

This code has been gathered and developed for educational purposes by **Ali Rahmani Nejad** and **Zahra Sarlak**.

### **Experimentation Results**

Below, final results of using two different characters as the mode and showing the result of minibatch is showed. These images are generated by the Generator unit.

**Fig. 1**- Simple GAN - mode 1 - 10k iteration

<img src="figs/simple-mode1-10k.JPG" width=400>

**Fig. 2**- Minibatch GAN - mode 1 - 10k iteration

<img src="figs/MB-mode1-10k.JPG" width=400>

**Fig. 3**- Simple GAN - mode 4 - 10k iteration

<img src="figs/simple-mode4-10k.JPG" width=400>

**Fig. 4**- minibatch GAN - mode 4 - 10k iteration

<img src="figs/MB-mode4-10k.JPG" width=400>

It is clear that the appearance of the mode and the similarity of other generated images is reduced as well.

Below, is the result of the experiment on CFar10. It took a lot of time and the low quality is due to lack of time. The mode is Cat in thie following experiment result.

**Fig. 5**- Simple GAN - mode cat - 8k iteration

**Fig. 6**- minibatch GAN - mode Cat - 8k iteration

### **Note**
Please note that for running this code it is necessary to use tensorflow version 1.15. For setting the version to this run the command below. 

``pip install tensorflow==1.15``

It can be even written and ran in your colab notebook.
